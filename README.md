Welcome to EUE, run using `npm run dev`.
Export using `npm run exportbuild` or `npm run exportrun`.

## What is this?
This project is trying to show the connections between the composition of European institutions and institutions on a member state/state/regional level.
You can find the data in `/src/data`, which uses TypeScript (`.ts`) files. This has been done so we can use language features (such as getting a party color for a group) and manipulate our data easier.

## Setup

### Run scripts
You need to run the `downloadNuts.py` script to collect some NUTS data
