# Welcome to `/src/data`!

## Why in `/src`?
Files in `/public` are static. That means, among other things, that
- they can't be updated at runtime
- they aren't optimized

## What are "territorial authorities"?
Territorial authority referes to any level of a member state (including the member state itself) that has political representation in some way or another.
There is expected to always be a "legislative" sort of branch and an "executive" sort of branch.

## Rules for parties
Parties in the same state should not have the same abbreviation/name, though parties in other states may have the same abbreviation/name, which leads to the abbreviation/name being prefixed (sometimes) by the abbreviation of the state they are in.
